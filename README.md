# Chess Knight's Pathfinding

This JavaScript project implements a solution to calculate the shortest possible path for a chess knight to travel between two squares on a standard 8x8 chessboard.

## Project Explanation

Knights in chess possess a unique movement pattern compared to other pieces. This project explores that movement and leverages search algorithms to determine the most efficient route between specified locations.

## Features

- _Shortest Path Determination_: Calculates the optimal path consisting of squares the knight must traverse to reach the destination.
- _Multiple Solution Handling_: Recognizes that there might be more than one shortest path and provides any valid solution.
